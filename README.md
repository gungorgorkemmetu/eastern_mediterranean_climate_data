# Eastern Mediterranean Climate Data
The repository is designed for training purposes in pandas, focusing on the graphical visualization of temperature and precipitation data from the Eastern Mediterranean Climate Center.

## Application

The data and codes were used by Gorkem Gungor for an online poster presentation in the Seventeenth IAMC Annual Meeting 2024 (IAMC-2024) and an in-person poster presentation in the International Conference on Resilience of Nuclear Installations against External Events from a Safety Perspective â€“ Focus on Climate Change (IAEA-RNI-2025).
